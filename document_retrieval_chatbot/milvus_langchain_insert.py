    """
    hello there we are your host Vivek and pavitra from the agile coach podcast in this podcast we bring fresh perspective to you through our interviews with thought leaders in Azle coaching facilitation business analysis and product management roles enjoy today we have Angela Johnson we have Angela as a CEO of collaborative leadership uh she's actually ran the company been a leader of a company for 14 years she's also a certified scrum trainer and a TBR instructor we're really excited to learn from you to
    Angela the first thing we want to kick it off is kind of having you share more about your work and what you've been up to yeah that's a great question we kind of started what I call our side hustle you know as somebody who offers training classes we get really tired of going to hotel ballrooms or you know what I mean and just the venue not being great so a few years ago our team was like why not do it for ourselves why not open our own training and event center and then we can license space out to other people
    who need it so we opened in February 2019 right before the global pandemic of course so pretty tough to have a training and Event Center when you have to be closed and so in reopening we've been pleasantly surprised at the number of people who are coming back to hold their events in person so the team is really focused on offering our space out to other people right now um in between doing what we do and offering you know our own classes so we're having fun seeing people again that's amazing um Angela we're gonna talk about some of
    the content that's in your book The scrum Master files I actually have started reading the book uh the first thing I want to start with is like what is the role of a scrum Master if you can kind of help paint the picture of what does the rule look like what are the responsibilities for us absolutely one of the things I try to highlight is the necessary people skills that scrum Master needs and so if people think it's going to be an administrative role that's not true at all this is more of a guide so somebody who's offering
    feedback making observations another stance a scrum Master will fall into is becoming a neutral objective facilitator to make conversations more productive and quite frankly just to help you know just to help those conversations yeah and then also The Stance of teacher you know when we talk about who is supposed to be helping the developers the product owner and the greater organization with learning this new way of working well that's that's again another responsibility of the scrum Master yeah um what would you say are like the
    people skills needed for a scrum Master role and yes right I always say people skills people skills more people skills so firstly you gotta like working with people because there honestly are some folks who are like I don't want to get involved I don't wanna you know work with people I like my my programming or I like my documents or whatever it is so they've got to want to do it they gotta like working with people yeah active listening is critical so actively neutrally listening because sometimes there's a lot in what's being
    said but more importantly there might be something to pick up on with what's not being said yeah and I know the cameras are tough I know everybody's tired of being on Zoom all day like we are here and being virtual but you can pick up on some of those non-verbal cues as well and I think it's needed more in Virtual so really being that neutral active facilitator actively listening and then not shying away from conflict because sometimes when you know people are just misunderstanding each other or communication is breaking down my scrum
    Master's got to get in there sometimes with their black and white stripes and their whistle almost like they're a referee but oftentimes it's just a help just to help move things forward yeah um Angela I'm curious how do you coach a new scrum Master you know we a lot of us we come from engineering background or Consulting background or come from the background or it's like we need to know things right like coming up with the answers and now somebody wants to go and do a scrum Master role where you're
    saying that it's it's active listening uh really being curious uh looking for what's being said what's not being said uh and then also you know asking these questions right so how do you code somebody to practice these skill sets Absolutely I'll pick up one of my own teammates when he was newer on the team he had come from a business analysis discipline so he had equated his Worth or the way he added value by typing or by writing because that's I mean what business analysts typically do and so to
    get him FAISSpaying attention more to the people involved we had to talk about what to do with his hands because he's like I don't know what to do with my hands I want to be writing or I want to be typing so I said put them in your pockets literally told him to put his hands in his pockets so that he wouldn't be tempted to take notes or to pick up a keyboard because then you're missing those opportunities and so now when you're focused in you don't need to know the subject matter to know when something's wrong for example
    if you mentioned Engineers or you mentioned you know developers if there's a lot of technical mumbo jumbo going around and you look at a product owner's face and you see see my crinkled eyebrows there yeah yeah you know that person's confused you don't need to know anything about the technical mumbo-jumbo to go hey the product owner looks confused so can you say it to the product owner in plain old words and if they say well if we do it that way it'll be really slow I didn't say slow the
    product owner might say it's like now you helped you're helping them understand each other so it takes tuning into the people part those reactions those facial expressions and whatnot not necessarily all the text speak or the or the subject matter yeah yeah I'm curious how um so for scrum message so somebody who is not in Tech and somebody wants to come go become a scrum Master they probably are strong and you know some people's skills relationship skills maybe even understand the coaching body of work
    when it comes to working intact like how much do they need to know but how do they need to prepare themselves so that they can be effective in the role I always say they don't need to know that domain and it's always odd to me when organizations will try to require that domain expertise because they'll say well they'd be better able to help solve impediments and that's not true because the scrum Master doesn't take every single impediment they take the impediments that the developers
    can't solve themselves they take the impediments that the product owner can sell themselves so all they need to do is to have that that Acumen for people's stuff and I've got some graduates who have come from somebody who has come from a customer service background made a great scrum Master at her company and talk about people skills yeah and having empathy when things are going wrong and listening and having patience oh my gosh just even patience yeah we have another graduate who had been in the um Services
    industry so bars and restaurants kind of kind of work yeah and the the place where she worked went out of business during covid she's now been a scrum Master for over a year oh wow by leveraging those people skills and the the company she's serving is actually quite technical so very capable uh at that that responsibility without having you know the technology background yeah and then I'm curious um curious so as you're coaching a new scrum master and somebody has uh the people experience working in customer
    service or in bartending right how do you coach them to be um Goods them to be more Curious and have a growth mindset if you have come across I'm pretty sure you have mm-hmm question asking you know and one of the things we talk about is open-ended questions or what I guess the industry would call powerful questions and for those people listening who might not understand the difference the least powerful question can always be answered with a yes or no do you want feedback no you know it's like end of question right
    this is conversation shut down an open-ended question would invite a response that that the person has to think about what could you do in the situation to help what did you do in this situation to help oh okay so that's more reflective now it requires a more open-ended answer so working on those question asking skills and the more powerful they can be the better right because the least powerful questions kind of paint us into a corner yeah yeah I love it um so being uh being neutral active listening being curious
    um you know open-minded growth minded you know being able to learn asking a powerful question um so these are essential core skill set of a scrum Master my question to you is uh like help us understand why are scrum Masters leaders because sometimes uh people think scrum Masters are just facilitators or meeting Setters right give us your mindset yeah right I I when you said that I have this horrible quote from somebody who shall remain nameless who doesn't really care for the scrum Master accountability who said well they
    just heard of the pizza right that's all they do is order the pizza it's like no and would have to be virtual pizza now with everybody working you know from home but the scrum Master is a true leader who serves is the way the new guide characterizes it and so when you think about a servant leadership mindset servant leaders don't make it all about themselves they make it about everybody else so they help everybody else they raise up or improve everybody else around them well that doesn't have to happen from a
    position of authority leader does an equal authoritarian right and so a scrum Master oftentimes will have to lead by example they may have to be exhibiting the very behaviors that we're asking other people to take on maybe we have to beg forgiveness sometimes instead of asking for permission maybe we have to have the courageous conversations with people in authoritarian positions in the organization to bring about change so it is a leadership role leaders don't necessarily have direct reports you know sometimes we tell
    ourselves these stories about the phrase leader that just isn't true you know acts of leadership can happen at any level in an organization yeah and and talking about coaching um scrum Masters also are the coaches for the team right so what does that look like what does uh a coaching scenario looks like for a scrum mastering the team great question and I'm going to qualify you know a scrum team is developers but it's also product owners so there's two-thirds of the scrum Master accountability there we have the people
    doing the work which we just call developers you know product developers and then the product owner but then there's this whole third of the scrum Master accountability about serving the greater organization so coaching the greater organization on the scrum team's behalf and what I always tell scrum Masters is it's not like you know somebody's gonna go I need some coaching or they might they might yeah so a lot of the work is going to happen outside of the scrum events there's going to be some some
    work that the scrum master has to put in to get to know everybody because not every approach is going to necessarily work with every member of the team of developers likewise not every approach that they use with the developers is going to work with a product owner or with a leader in the organization so a lot of that investment in time is going to happen outside of the scrum events everything from making observations giving feedback asking some of those powerful questions to get people into self-reflection so that they can improve
    so that they can grow yeah and I'm asking this question on behalf of somebody who's probably you know who understands the teams scrum or have gone through some training but doesn't have experience working in a in a large uh you know Healthcare company or large company where there's a lot of accountability outside of the scrum team right if you could give us some examples of like what does those engagements or conversations look like outside of your team with some examples that that would be really cool awesome and I almost
    heard you say asking for a friend right so there's a couple different stances that we talked about at the beginning of this conversation you know we talked about the stance of coaching but then also neutral facilitation and teaching so those stances are also potentially taking place outside of the scrum team so let's say that the product owner has to have a pretty high stakes conversation that really is refinement with some stakeholders and subject matter experts they're not ready to engage the developers just yet while a scrum Master
    can serve that product owner and serve that organization by being available to mutually facilitate the conversation it may go a whole lot more effectively if they do because a product owner definitely isn't neutral the product owner right is is operating from a position of authority about their product yeah there may be something that a stakeholder or a leader is doing that's actually preventing the scrum team from reaching their goals and objectives such as pulling somebody off the team right well I'm just going to
    borrow vivec for a special project yeah he doesn't he's not needed full-time on this scrum team well wait a minute that's hurting our ability to get our goals and objectives bent but an appropriate use of the scrum Masters time and energy to go have a conversation with that person to find out what's really at The Rook cause are there other Alternatives do you need to tap the person from the scrum team away so any of those kinds of things would be perfectly within Instagram Masters Wheelhouse in terms of serving outside
    the scrum team yeah yeah Angela one thing I want to make real for uh for the listeners when we talked a lot about neutral right like this it's it's a word so what is not what is not neutral thing that scrum Master say or do sound like oh yeah I got a whole bunch of those there's there's this annoying little phrase that I hear from some scrum Masters where they'll say I'm taking my scrum Master hat off right now and I'm putting my QA head on to tell you that you're forgetting about regression
    testing and you're forgetting okay first of all there's no hats yeah yeah it's just no hats so if a scrum Master were to phrase things like that what they're really telling people I know better than you I'm smarter than you when it comes to testing wait a minute you just disempowered your team you didn't help them you didn't help them grow and you definitely weren't neutral if you were asserting your own opinion yeah you know so I there's a scrum master who literally said things like that because he did
    come from a quality assurance background yeah my coaching to him my feedback to him was hey what what is bothering you right what is going on and he's like well they always forget regression testing and I said okay so instead of making it about you and telling them what they're doing wrong why don't you invite their participation why don't you get them to come up with the answer so why did you try saying what's that thing that we've forgotten the last couple Sprints you know where you don't break
    something that used to work and he goes yeah then they're just gonna come up with the answer that it's regression testing and I said so if they come up with the answer guess what they're likely to do going forward they're actually likely to remember it it's not about you right got it we got to get our ego out of it so we gotta stay neutral yeah I love that so you're saying that you know as as an active member um coach facilitator leader you're paying attention to what's happening
    you're paying attention to what is the company trying to deliver what's happening in the delivery what's happening in the team you have all the data it's just you're not giving the answer you're just asking questions so that you're pulling the answers and you're helping the team members see that but you're doing that by coaching and asking powerful questions absolutely and there's even you know not just at you know the the developer Team level for skill set there was a um
    functional manager right there was a manager of the developers at a client I just worked with right before the holidays last year and every conversation she would be writing notes for the developers she would be capturing their technical tasks coming out of Sprint planning she would chase down technical things in the organization as a manager and the scrum Master couldn't get through to her so they had me try and I was trying to point out if you're doing all those things your developers aren't going to
    grow and here was her answer and I I had to laugh out loud she's like I'm just doing it until they learn how until they get better at doing it um what how do you get better at doing something yeah by actually doing it so here she's literally taking away their opportunity to grow and to learn with the excuse that she's doing it so they can learn and I'm like wow yeah I know right yeah so I think it took just even a neutral who doesn't work there you know playing it back because to everyone else in that
    environment that had just become the way we do things right that that had just become the status quo so sometimes staying neutral you can pick up on a lot more yeah Angela I I'm pretty sure you do interview scrum Master formally or informally right so I I have this question that I wanted to ask you like how do you assess somebody's um conflict mediation skills uh how are they about conflict what kind of questions do they ask what what kind of how do you assess that in in a potential scrum Master candidate
    the most powerful way is to give a scenario because if you were to say you know Vivek are you okay with conflict yeah sure I am I'm great during kind of like you know how would we ever know so I prefer to paint uh a mental picture kind of like the case studies in the scrum Master files so I'll literally set up it's Sprint planning it is um topic three of Sprint planning where we're getting into the technical tasks and two of your developers just start arguing and one firmly believes their way is the best way to deliver the
    solution and the other person firmly believes theirs is the best the team is split down the middle and doesn't really know what to say because these two are fighting what do you do nice now you're actually going to hear the steps that they'll go through and you'll get so much more information out of setting up a scenario and letting them respond to it it then you know just asking yes or no questions in an interview yeah yeah definitely and um what what do you think is an optimal way for scrum Mass to show
    up in different conflicts you know inside team conflict outside cross-team conflicts how do you how do you approach and Coach uh to new scrum Masters well one of our values in the scrum framework is respect so I never underestimate the power of a break you know and if there's a lot of people involved and there's just one or two like an example I just gave you know maybe call for a break and just ask the two people that are having the conflict or the issue to hang back so we can get to the root cause of what it actually is
    other people will thank you for that because some people don't like being in those conversations even if they're not one of the active participants in the disagreement they may just be a bystander but sometimes just you can feel the tension and so I'll always err on the side of letting people save face you know I'm not doing it in some sort of public forum so I'll call for a break call for a timeout and then reconvene and start attacking it based on what the root cause is once I find out you know what's
    really at the heart of the issue nice thank you um so scrum Master like how do scrum Master identify coachable and teachable moments how do they do that I know it's such an art it's it's you know kind of part skill and part art because I always tell new scrum Masters it's not like developers are going to go we have an impediment although they might right they might be like oh my machine is down today or whatever those are the easy ones the ones that aren't easy are where you have to listen for where people are
    literally talking past each other or you can tell somebody is so confused but they are not asking questions so yeah would it be helpful for a neutral to say can we just go around the room and ask the question that you still need addressed or ask a clarifying question however big or small no you just took the pressure off you made it okay to let people do that because it's less about knowing all the details about it and more about making sure they understand so it's going to take being there it's going to take practice and it's going to
    take a lot of kind of that art that Nuance as opposed to one specific thing every single time and people are going to be different too all the different people on the scrum team you might have to vary your approach a little bit depending on who's talking or who is involved 100 yeah so Angela last question for this episode um what do people not understand about scrum Master role from like the the hiring the team perspective the hiring team perspective and also from uh somebody who's trying to go into the
    scrum Master role it is not a secretary the scrum Master if done effectively is not about keeping notes keeping artifacts and being the Scribe for the team and I feel like I fell into that trap because I did come from IT project management when I was first in the scrum Master uh role when I was newer and I still see that today I still hear from scrum Masters that say they expect me to take the notes uh no because then they're not learning I have this little phrase I use in the book and recently on social media somebody let me
    know they didn't care for the phrase but my phrase is get your hands off the teams work yes and it's just it's just a catchy little way to kind of remind yourself wait a minute because if you're doing what they're supposed to be doing you're kind of missing those teachable coachable moments you talked about and it's really not about that and so they took that phrase too literally because they're like what if the scrum Master could help by making some coffee and I'm like hey
    I'm all for that right however they can add value I'm talking about not falling into the Trap of being their notetaker and so many job descriptions right now or so many people really think it's some kind of a project management role and it's totally different yeah beautiful thank you so much Angela I learned a lot I'm really excited to read your book and we'll definitely do a second episode just doing deep dive into some of the case studies I really appreciate this thank you so much thanks for having me

    hello there we are your host Vivek and pavitra from the agile coach podcast in this podcast we bring fresh perspective to you through our interviews with thought leaders in Azle coaching facilitation business analysis and product management roles enjoy hello everybody today we have Abby demartino in the podcast Abby thank you so much for agreeing to come on the podcast um we've actually known each other for a number of years and I've seen Abby do some amazing things in her career so very happy to highlight her accomplishment the work
    that he's done over the past few years and I have a few questions that I've sourced from um our podcast listeners and students they want to know get the perspective of a development manager um so Abby's background sees a development manager for a company called Myers leads a few different engineering teams and has had scrum Master experience prior to this and also comes from Sports coaching background um so really excited to get into your story uh with that Abby tell us a little bit more about what you've been up to uh
    at work these days okay thanks leave it thanks for having me um so like you didn't mentioned I work for um a company called Meyer it's a grocery store in the midwest we also have a digital platform and a mobile app platform mobile app platform so I'm on the digital side of things I manage two teams in our back end Services space uh two scrum teams right now we are working on one team is focused on modernizing uh our current services so a lot of our services are on premise they are focused on migrating those to the
    cloud that's going to reduce downtime insulate us and reduce customer friction my other team is learning um event driven architecture through confluent Kafka so that's a newer technology that's come out recently it's going to help the coupler services and again make us more dependable for our customers and our website so they do back-end work for that it's very behind the scenes no one really knows what is going the customer um does not know how many services are called when they're perusing our website
    but my team my teams are the ones building that in the back end awesome Abby let's let's go to where um like prior Tech world like give us an idea um about what kind of work you're doing you're obviously coaching um and you're working in the Academia setting too yeah and give us your background and how you um you know learn about tech and all this yeah so I I come from an interesting background um I've played volleyball my whole life I um played in college as well and so I originally majored in Psychology and I
    was thinking about being a therapist I love working with people and I had one extra year of college eligibility so I ended up playing five years of college I was able to get my Master's Degree in sport management so I had psychology and Sport management um I ended up working in athletics Administration and then coaching on the side I was in NCAA compliance assistant director of NCAA compliance at my alma mater which was rules and regulations for student athletes working with coaches um yeah I was on the higher education route
    uh hoping to stay in college athletics and the pandemic hit and I realized that I was not as passionate about College athletics as I thought I was being on the other side of it was a very different perspective than what I'd seen as a student athlete myself so I I started exploring the tech World um I think the skills that I learned from first of all being on a team and learning how to lead a team even though it was Sports I could still translate that and just do the same thing for developers that's what took me into the
    scrum world yeah um that's amazing yeah I remember talking to you and you know talking uh learning about the NCCA world and the coaching especially in pandemic that was that was a crazy time um so let's kind of uh avoid so that you know there were a few different tracks right like you could go become a business analyst product owner you could go into a coding boot camp you could have been a devops engineer like how did you decide um on choosing scrum master and why did you do it um just curious so I originally I think a big part of it
    was falling in love with the agile framework um even though I was working in higher education the research and the classes I was taking with you Vivek was exposing how dysfunctional it was um and I think that can happen at a university it can happen at a Fortune 500 it can happen anywhere um it's very easy for organizations to go awry and get dysfunctional real quick so I was noticing pain points identifying ways in which we could be more efficient just based on what I'd been learning and you know the team
    aspect has always you know interested me I've been on a team my entire life I've been identified as a leader early on and so I think the opportunity to get into the tech world and take what I've learned through college athletics and just apply it to a totally different people group it still works it's still the same concepts of you know being a good coach creating team culture creating efficient people and so that's really what interested me was you know that scrum Master role in which I could be a leader
    still um and help teams win be that servant leader that could get stuff out to production on time it's a big win yeah totally totally um so yeah and in terms of like the transferable skills coming in as a coach working in Academia uh what are some of the things what were the transferable skills and how did you use those skills in your interview or like how you're branding yourself I'd love to kind of uh go into that and the reason behind is because we have a lot of um interest from people from Athletics
    coaching teaching background uh people want to learn and people think oh I don't have any experience in uh in the agile world but in in a way they do some experience have some experience from a facilitation coaching mentoring perspectives so I'm curious uh what areas that um that you're able to kind of use in your branding yeah so um I think being a part of a team requires a lot of communication um you need to build relationships with your teammates uh I had to do that on the court because there's six people on
    the court we're all going after one objective to win right yeah um but you have to communicate with your teammates as the ball is going back and forth over than that and who's who's going to take this pass who's going to you know take this serve and um that was so easily transferable to the tech world because when you get a body of work and um for a scrum team it's like okay here's the body of work who's gonna take it how are we gonna work together on it how are we going to deliver it as
    efficiently as possible um so I didn't realize that I was developing skills that could transfer to the tech world and while I was doing it but looking back very similar Concepts communication is huge building up a strong team culture is huge right people that enjoy the work they're doing and who they're working with or going to produce more efficiently and produce better results um another big thing that I think the tech world needs more of is a competitive mindset so um I've always had a competitive mindset
    and with agile in you know whichever framework we're using at your company you're always tracking how work is getting completed how quickly it's getting completed and how much money you're making and what it costs right so yeah businesses care about money um yeah they want efficient teams and if I'm you know when I was a scrum master I was more of a leader of influence rather than an actual manager but leading those teams um to success and then now as a manager like if my teams aren't delivering then
    that falls on me so having that competitive mindset to make teams efficient make teams as best or as you know as strong as they can be constantly improving was very very transferable yeah I mean I love um that that's such a fresh perspective I've actually done you know close to 100 podcasts this is the first time somebody brought in the the competitiveness uh and yeah in a way you are measuring and you're trying to get um get good right so if you have that from sports or whatever you bring it um and if you can facilitate teams in a
    way where you're driving teams to improve um that that's an amazing point of view thanks for sharing that um what uh I would say so let's say there were still some challenges right there there were a lot of things that were like you could you could bring in you had a community of support of instructors and mentors and a few other friends that you know had made this transition too but what were some of the challenging uh challenges that you faced uh in the in that transition process how transparent do you want me to be
    I mean yeah this is this is uh this is going out to people who are you know really want to know like what it takes what it takes to like go become a scrum Master a lot of the time people think that oh I just said I'll take a few classes and you know it just I'll get this six figure job so um you can actually hear what it takes yeah um to be totally honest I was in tears at first I was extremely overwhelmed I thought I was in way over my head um first of all I hadn't worked at a major company before I'd been in higher
    education like I mentioned earlier so even just company jargon and being in a massive organization our department alone is 400 people so um you know Meyer is is a grocery store that spans in Six States in the midwest it's a big big company so um I think coming in hearing a lot of terms and org structures and how we run day to day was overwhelming um the biggest part too was feeling like I was constantly talking to people who were smarter than me all day every day and I was like why am I here I shouldn't
    I shouldn't be in this role this is I don't know enough technology to be in this role um so the first the first few months are very tough and it's very overwhelming but my piece of advice for that those first few months is to lean on the people who know the work and what they're working on so you're developers right if you're going to come in as a scrum master your your first task needs to be building relationships with your team so build up that relationship and then I found myself attending as many ceremonies as possible
    so I would go to their demos I would go to their groomings I would go any ceremony they had their mob session um when you know all the dads get together and prepare a program I'm going to that and because I built relationships with those people I felt like I could ask the question and you can say hey this might be a stupid question but can you explain this to me in a high level and just like throwing yourself into it and being vulnerable enough to ask questions we'll help you in the long run like and then you know
    everyone like I'm blessed to be in a company where everyone's very very nice and no one would be frustrated with my questions they they were not very understanding and so just like getting over yourself and getting over your ego and um being able to ask for support from from your engineers yeah it was a great way to learn yeah probably because you're really showing up uh in these team interactions and building trust that that is probably the reason why they were also supportive because yeah you know you had that connection and the
    trust and people can say right somebody's actually putting a real effort yeah and people want to help ubar says if you go to somebody you've not built any connection you just come to the meeting and say what is this so people aren't too excited sometimes about um you know just giving you the answer that's readily available um so no that's amazing um Abby what would you say like what advice you know you've obviously paid your dues you learned the tech you know you learn that role and you've now you
    know became a development manager and now you're leading a team of um developers um what advice would you give to uh The Abbey when you are in like interviewing like trying to get your first like scrum Master role uh and also like once you got the job now then you have to learn and do the job right you know in a big Corporation what what kind of advice do you have um for the um I think it's really easy to fall back on the excuse of I didn't study computer science in college um I didn't go through coding boot camps
    I I'm not technical um so I can't do this I shouldn't do this and I would tell myself that a lot in the beginning like Oh I'm a scrum master and like I don't really need to fully understand what they're doing which is true but think of how more effective you can be if you do take the time to understand it so I think talking about earlier like talking about being competitive but you need to be competitive with yourself too like you need to have that drive because this day and age there are so many resources out
    there in which you can learn and so like if you want to be the best scrum Master the best ad manager um you do need to know the technology and you have the resources to learn that technology so it's it's just taking the time um to go through and do it and so I think like I'm I know I need to flex my other skills my other leadership skills my communication skills relationship building skills more than my technical skills but I still need those technical skills and I can't make the excuse of oh I don't have a bachelor's degree in
    computer science so like telling myself like you that is maybe that can maybe like set me back a little bit but it's not the end-all be-all and you just need to give yourself the time to learn the tech and you'll be fine um I would also tell myself to be patient I want to be good at something as soon as I start it so it took me a lot of time to figure out the company figure out how my team's functioned best um I think just giving yourself patience and Grace there um would be huge because yeah at first I
    was like oh I'm gonna get fired I don't know what I'm doing but then like you know a year and six months later I was promoted so yeah I think just being patient with yourself and giving yourself Grace but then also being hungry to learn like you need to be hungry to learn that's that's such a good advice um Abby because you know what I see it's and I I totally empathize with um you know those who are in this like in the state where you're that story like oh I'm I'm not a techie or I don't
    understand Tech I'm not an engineer that story is such a like a strong like belief that um I see only a few people um get can get past that even after being a scrum Master for years so I I definitely commend you for uh in having that attitude like hey like what if I just learn it how much more effective can I be instead of just playing through the same stories like I'm not in Tech um how um any any other strategies like what what did you do like to get over those limiting beliefs uh like or or some things that you did or advice that
    you have uh for people who are Clinging On to I don't have the experience I don't I'm not a techie I'm not qualified all these imposter syndrome what can people do yeah um I I worked very closely with my boss on like a game plan for um ways that I can learn uh I think this day and age you can you know I'd say oh I want to get more familiar with.
    net and C sharp programming Google it and there will be tutorials or YouTube videos or like my company has some really solid learning platforms that we partner with um go on udemy sign up like you're investing in yourself when you're if you find something that you just don't get you write it down that was something else I did a lot of so I'd be sitting in meetings I would hear a ton of terminology that I had no idea what they were talking about and I'm just jotting it down as they're talking and then on
    my own time after the meeting I'm Googling it and you will you know learn about it and then next time someone demos something if one of your engineers is demoing you have that context where you can ask a question about it and they'll gain respect there because yeah like if you're just saying oh I'm not technical then they're not going to respect you because they are technical they're very smart people they're an engineer for a reason right so if you're just like hands off like I'm not technical no like
    learn it speak their language watch their demos and then ask questions and they'll be like oh she does get it okay like they'll respect you more as a leader totally totally so like whatever things you didn't get you just literally wrote it down you know on a sticky note you went to Google and you literally just like just stared at the information and some of it you got it and then you probably just watched some YouTube videos yeah that you know what it's not that hard to do that actually you know
    um so yeah and obviously you know the thing that a lot of um you know I was definitely in their shoes that was like a decade ago right and working with developers in Escrow Masters you know one of the perspective that I had is like oh wow like developers have to learn like every day they're like faced with so much uncertainty and they have to like learn technical stuff new stuff they don't know every day and if sometime if we are the change agents and facilitator um you know it really helps if we are we
    have that experience of learning and dealing with somebody something new something that's a little messy that makes us a little bit uncomfortable um so yeah I definitely realized that early part of my career too is uh it it it definitely helps so I'm really glad glad that you're able to get past that and um you know now um you're you're kind of in a leadership role right so um so switching switching the gear back um so you you virus from Master role you've got the experience you learned the tech
    and obviously uh you you got the promotion but what what are some things that you did uh that can help um contribute to this promotion or your leadership seeing that okay Abby like you're doing the work so what what might be those attributes or things that actions that you took yeah so I think the scrum Master role can go in a lot of different directions um it is easy it is comfortable to coast and stay within your team and only worry about your team and just run ceremonies and if someone pings you and has a blocker then try and
    stop in you can do that that is not going to set you apart so I did um my company follows the scaled agile framework for the most part um I set up a community of practice so met with my peers learned from them um I started driving projects that were going across the Enterprise so if we had dependencies in other areas um you know we have a pharmacy in our stores so working with people in Pharmacy showing that you can collaborate with others outside of just your team I think set me up for that because that was part of the interview
    when I was applying for my manager's role um to be honest I always thought in my org at least that the next step for me would be release train engineer so I applied for a release train engineer I did not get that job I was told that I didn't have the mindset to implement specific processes but I had the people mindset and I was actually asked would you want to be a leader of people and have people report to you and run teams multiple teams and so I kind of fell into it like didn't get that job but
    then um you know the interview panel had had different different ideas for me but I think just being especially in a virtual world you need to find ways to get yourself in the spotlight so volunteering for things like if we're doing a train systems demo hey I'll facilitate that I'll you know show your face in front of the leadership staff um find ways to you know make it known of what your team is working on whether that being you know here's some shout outs here's what team X completed I want
    to shout out these people um just finding ways to show what you can do outside of your day-to-day with your team I think is is super beneficial yeah wow that's that's amazing Abby I really acknowledge you for um like doing all this work I I remember you know like you be in that crying stage and like everybody had a lot of imposter syndrome and um yeah it's going from there to like you know taking all these initiatives on your own and like really making it happen and you know now being in the states so I really want to acknowledge
    you for all the hard work that you've done um I think so yeah um all right a few other questions that I that we got from um the the students in the audience is like now you're in the hiring panels now you're hiring scrum Masters developers product owners um and what are what are some things that uh let's kind of Spotlight a little bit more of a um product owner ba scrum Master role so when you're hiring for these rules uh what are you really looking for in the candidates so something that's really important to me
    in my in candidates that I'm looking I'm looking for is the ability to see a need and feel a need that's kind of a mantra that we have in our org um it's very easy to sit back and watch uh if you notice whether it's in the virtual environment of like Microsoft teams like someone saying hey can anyone help with this like I'm expecting the people I hire to be like yep got it what can I do um that's important I also think I personally looked for competitive people too um I want someone who cares about the
    work cares about producing quality work um if that's from the product owner perspective um you know truly being a product owner know your product and understanding it in my case like having a technical product owner so someone who's a little bit more technical but um working with the team to build a healthy backlog but just that go-getter I think there is a lot of folks out there that just coast and just you know go eight to five and just you know don't really go above and beyond and I'm looking for someone with fire and
    someone who cares and wants to win you know like wants yeah wants to have you know a team that produces good work and um I think I think the scrum master and the product owner rules are tough like they're it's a unique personality that you need you need someone who's driven you need someone who can handle conflict you can mean you need someone who's able to have difficult conversations if there's conflict within the team um hopefully those people mitigate that before it gets to me right I yeah for
    people who can solve problems and not just run to their manager and say oh this is going on in the team like what do I do it's like no take initiative like yeah learn how to solve the conflict so um that's kind of what I look for it's I know it sometimes a bit much but I have high expectations for my teams and so um I look for a very specific person totally totally um so like you you've been uh you you've been is this a remote role or or I'm a hybrid so I'm in the office corporate campus Monday through
    Wednesday and then home Thursday Friday and your your teams are distributed correct they are yup so um some come in occasionally they they are not required to be in the office they can come in if they want and then others are all over the U.S yeah what what kind of things have you seen from a hiding perspective like in the through the pandemic working remotely and yeah like trains things like that yeah um it's interesting I think there is some people out there who are like the person that I just hired as a software engineer
    was looking for a different job because his company was fully remote and he craved human interaction and he was wanting the option to go into the office if if so um I think one thing I've noticed just even though there are people in office you know we never have meetings where everyone's all in person even if some are in person someone's always dialing in so um I think the meeting fatigue is real um I think jumping from meeting to meeting to meeting especially in a manager's perspective um developers you know Engineers aren't
    involved as many meetings with scrum Masters product owners like they're in meetings all day and and so I've noticed a lack of Engagement um I think people are oh I'm just sitting staring at a screen camera off uh multitasking and I think that's gonna hurt us um if we don't have more of an Engaged mindset um as we get through meetings throughout the day so I'm guilty of it too like you know you have multiple monitors and you're on a call on one and then you're looking at messages on the other and I
    think it's leading to a lot of distracted people um so see that as you know how would it say like a pain point but more of just an observation so when I'm hiring people I'm looking for candidates that improve that they're engaged um even if it's ever it's it's usually a virtual interviews but like you know are they using their hands are they engage are they looking at the camera are they have their notes on the other screen and they're looking to the right well and you know I can see that on the interview
    but yeah um yeah yeah it's a weird time weird time but I think we're still getting through it post pandemic um I think the work working world's just changed it will never be the same it will never be Monday through Friday in office for everyone so I'm just adjusting to that yeah my my last question Abby is like what are some of the challenges challenges that you get to face at this point of a career um and the work that you do and what are the elements that you really love uh I'd love to hear that
    what's rewarding yeah uh challenges I think would be trying to keep up with ever-changing technology um you know we're we're in the e-commerce industry we're in the grocery industry it's competitive we're facing supply chain issues so um we're trying to build up our website and our mobile app and you know make it make our pickup experience better in our online ordering experience better so there's a lot of pressure on digital right now because our website and mobile app did not exist pre-pandemic I mean it
    did but it was not very user friendly yeah so when when everyone was scared to go to the grocery store uh we needed to come up with a solution to serve our customers and provide curbside pickup so um teams were seriously building that out as quickly as possible um and I think just continuing to evolve that like a lot of our competitors are you know starting to toy around with what AI is going to look like in the grocery experience so um that's something that you know we we want to stay competitive with what can we do in
    our mobile app can we build a shopping list using Ai and have you know them tell you the recipes and things like that as you shop at the grocery store so oh wow it's a competitive industry um but it's a it's a high you know a fast-paced industry so I wouldn't say it's necessarily a challenge of just always having to be ready to apply new technology and you know make make it the best experience for our customers uh yeah as far as rewarding rewarding parts of my job um I think as a scrum master I always
    felt like I could see pain points at the team level and um I didn't have any power to do anything about it per se uh now being in a leadership role I think I can drive change hear what's impacted my team and I don't know what other word to say besides Authority but I don't mean Authority but like yeah the ability to implement some of that change um has been really exciting and just seeing wins in my team right so they're getting out a big body of work to production that they've spent you
    know multiple sprints on and to see it through and celebrate that with them um and then just getting to coach people every day like I I have scrum Masters and product owners report to me now so I'm able to work with them build up their leadership skills so that they can lead their teams better has been really fun um but yeah just trying to coach people and progress them in their careers has definitely been one of the funnest Parts yeah yeah and that's amazing and Abby you you're getting to do this in such
    early part of your career which you know I'm wishing you all all the best um on on the future uh Endeavors and yeah thank you so much for this this podcast uh I'm sure listeners are going to get a lot of value out of it and yeah I'm definitely rooting for you thank you so much thank you Vivek all right that's a wrap with this episode thank you for listening till the end we hope these podcasts are providing value on your agile Journey if you haven't visited our website the agilecoach.com we highly

    hello there we are your host Vivek and pavitra from the agile coach podcast in this podcast we bring fresh perspective to you through our interviews with thought leaders in Azle coaching facilitation business analysis and product management roles enjoy hey everybody today we have Michaela McCarty scrum Master as a coach in our podcast we're really excited to get to know about her background as a scrum Master she's an amazing coach in helping people become scrum Masters and currently works as a scrum Master at
    Universal welcome to the show today Michaela we would love to hear more about you and what you're up to for having me I am so excited to be here to share a little bit of story in my dream me um so yeah it's kind of like you said I currently work at Universal Parks and Resorts um I am a scrum master and they're um I'm a school Master at marketing but I actually work in digital and technology department so basically I run marketing operational teams there um and really I am someone that um somewhere there trying to continue to
    Aid the transformation of scrum and agile in a marketing world and so I do a lot of coaching a lot of spinning up of teams and just really um helping to standardize our agile processes between um all of our Parks here in Orlando and our parks in Hollywood as well as our two new Ventures that will be in Las Vegas and Texas so it's very exciting time right now in the agile World especially um a new Venture into agile marketing and so that's kind of what I'm currently doing now as well as doing a lot of
    coaching on the side to help people and clients become scrum Masters great um Michaela what is a scrum Master how to help us understand that role really great question so a scriptmaster is someone who oversees process on an agile team and basically what an agile team is is a team of cross-functional team members so think of we're not just a team of just teachers or a team of just soccer players we are a goalie we are a coach we're a soccer player we're an assistant we are a team of a cross-functional
    um in the sense that we can take a piece of work such as making a pizza even to switch analogies and yeah my team members can do one slice one slice one slice one slice to make a full pie and we can celebrate so a cross-functional team is basically a team set up of different cross-functional departments to execute a single batch of work quickly to the customers um and then the scrum Masters role and that is just to oversee the process and make sure that we are delivering that pizza on time yeah great uh and and for the for the
    folks who are from the non-tech side like um let's kind of speak from a value perspective what kind of value does an Instagram Master add to the agile team that you talked about that's a really great question so on an agile team you have different members obviously so you have a product owner who their sole responsibility is to prioritize the work and they drive business value so they are taking that work in from the stakeholders and saying what in a long list of tasks which is the most important for right now a scrum
    Master's role is to then take whatever they're prioritizing and say how are we going to get it done product owner is the what in the team the scrum Masters are the how that's the value that we provide to the team is okay they're saying we got to get this done we have the team members ready to do the work the scrum Master will then say this is how it's going to work nice nice um because I'm curious so on a week to let's say let's take a Sprint in two weeks uh water what are things that
    scrum Masters do um again for folks who are kind of learning about the rules for the first time um what are some things you you do in a week to week or on a Sprint for the team or outside of the team yeah so uh we currently run our experience in two weeks it's pretty much an industry standard it's about like 10 working day Sprint so basically within those 10 days um you know we have scrum ceremonies uh within those scrum ceremonies there are basically uh five ceremonies to basically Drive output for your team so
    you have a backlog refinement session that session is led by my product owner I Aid support to her in that session and then we have Sprint planning um and this will change per team in every company is is different this is all self-determined within our team how we lead these and so um you know uh within those two weeks we have Sprint planning where we take everything prioritized in the backlog and we add that to the Sprint my role in that session as a scrum master I lead that session based off of the priorities
    that my product owner sets um after we do the Sprint I pull metrics so a lot of my week is spent sorting through metrics um coaching my team on story pointing and estimation and role relative sizing my goal of the team is to really make sure that we are taking in just the right amount of work for us that we're not under delivering or over delivering that we're actually doing what we can do we are capacity based team so um I monitor that by sorting through metrics and burn down charts and basically coming to the team and saying
    like this is in like building historical data I think the biggest value that a scrum Master can bring to a team is being able to give reality to expectations in the term of stakeholders and your partners the stakeholder comes to me and says can your team do this I can give them an answer of a yes or a no yes because we have room and capacity I monitor that or no because of this I need to always have an answer to a yes or a note to my stakeholders and that is really the main goal of a script Master is to protect the team and be that heat
    shield by communicating out for them so you know I do that with my metrics um I'll leave the daily stand-ups you know uh which is not a status checking meaning it's really how's the Sprint going meeting do you have blockers um that drive straight into team retrospectives I also think that is a scrum Master where we do a look back and say the last batch of work do um you know if we had five big batches of work carry over we'll talk about why did we story point wrong where is our Kinks um and then that will drive to our end
    of Sprint demo our Showcase of work where we basically didn't showcase our work so you know those are my role on the team in the scrimmaster is to One schedule those sessions make sure that they happen yeah team is showing up make sure the team is participating and then making sure that we are driving results out of every single meeting and tangible outputs and that they're documented and saved and acted upon so that's 15 things but that's a lot of hands in multiple buckets But ultimately with the goal of
    driving results for your team protecting your team and you know making sure that they're happy too happy too we'll do great work so I merely keeping morale high as well 100 yeah um I want to go back to your story Michaela when I connected with you I was fascinated by a story of how you became a scrum master so kind of give us from like right after college like what did you do to go become a scrum master so that's a great question so I went to UCF I am actually an interdisciplinary student which basically means I I did
    half business school half Communications and my minor was leadership interdisciplinary UCF is like three very different categories all coming together to make one big um one big degree so I was in that path I do you really know what I wanted to do I know that I loved communication I know that I love presenting I thought I wanted to be a news broadcast anchor and so I actually when I was a junior in college I was working at a media company doing just project coordination different type of work and I just one day was like I I don't know if this is
    for me I I don't know you know when you're in college it is it's a lot to try to figure out your path and I actually Googled that day like highest paying jobs and project management and the first one that came up was technical project manager and I was not technical I did not take any technical classes uh my technical skills went as far as maybe putting things into Excel that was about it um but I was like that sounds like pretty fascinating maybe I could do it I ended up closing my laptop and going uh
    to the Starbucks down the street started doing my homework um that day I got approached by just the two two older like businessmen in a non-creepy way because I was watching my class and they asked me what I was studying and it was funny because earlier that day I kind of made a path with myself that the next person to ask me what I was going to do when I graduated I was gonna just tell them I was going to be a technical project manager just for like the fun of it that I didn't I don't really believe in
    manifesting I believe in working hard for what you want but I just was like I'm so excited telling people that because no um and I got asked that question that's it and I whipped around and I said I want to do a technical project manager wow and uh he said interesting I I own a software company which is wild the story is kind of like one in a million a little bit because I I own a software company we're looking to hire someone who can run the front desk and just kind of like wants to learn about scrum and I
    was like and he he handed me his business card and said come come down and interview tomorrow and I'll tell you all about it um and so I remember I went back I went right back to the office updated my resume and sent it to him and you know I know that like that story and that interaction is such a one in a million story but I always love to emphasize the fact that you never know who you're talking to um always be careful but you know especially when you're in a business setting you're at a networking event to
    work the room and you know really be bold and state what you want to people who are around you who might be listening everyone's always listening um and so that's like what I always love to emphasize about that story you know you may not get approached with someone offering you a job in a tech company in the sense that I was but yeah what he noticed in me was that I was very bold I was quick to shake my hand I was not shy and those are some of the core personality traits that you need as to be a successful scrum Master you kind of
    need to be able to command a room um it's a long story short I as a junior in college um lock myself up into an office and he uh it was a small uh software startup um they were creating a project management software I didn't know anything he said in the interview but I just shook my head like I understood like I was tracking it did not understand anything and he goes uh he looked right through me he goes I know you don't understand any of this but if you're willing to learn I'm willing to
    teach you and that was like if you're willing to teach me I'm willing to learn tears um and he said it's going to be a lot of hard work um yeah okay I'm not afraid of hard work what I needed in that season was a mentor I needed someone to invest in me um again that's what I'd like to drive home with my story personally is you know if you don't have a mentor you gotta go out and find one you need to invest in one you need to search you need to make connections because there are people out there willing to put in
    effort into the Next Generation I was so so lucky to find one who invested in me um and that is a huge huge thing especially when you're in college and so basically I uh I took the job uh I started running their office and I got subs for the developers and him every single day I stock the office with snacks and in return he let me to he um me to begin shadowing shadowing the meetings taking notes yeah you know I began to be a part of watching an active scrum team he he put me in White Room sessions and you know and um it was not
    easy there are days I went home crying because I was like this is too much I I would do my homework in college and then on Sunday night I would study to go do my job on Monday um I put in work in that season yeah in a time where um Instagram was blowing up everyone was an Instagram model or influencer or something else and I was like should I be doing something else but there was just something in me and my my mentor would remind me he goes yeah one day he put two numbers up on a whiteboard because if you go this route you'll make
    this much if you keep doing this you'll make this much and I was like okay and I just really felt it in my soul that I was in the right place doing the right thing and I knew it would pay off despite you know kind of like almost dying in those two years of working and but yeah I would I wouldn't take anything back it was the most transformative years of my entire life working for that start yeah this isn't junior senior year right like you you went through you juggle the classes and you went to these meetings
    you cried in some of the meetings you had a lot to learn um yeah right in my car a ton on my way to online study at UCF because I had exams the next day yeah wow that's an awesome story um yeah and curious like what kind of what kind of things um was your Mentor able to help you see uh in those years where you had no clue about technical stuff like any of this like what was the most helpful part so his biggest philosophy his biggest thing that he wants he just was having multiple Tools in your twofolds we were a small startup
    company um a team and he would actively tell us almost every single day that no job is not your job if there's a need you fill it if you don't know go learn it and so he was such a big advocate of learning the skills around you um listening in and never being like compartmentalizing like I don't do that I'm a scrum master or I don't do that I'm a PO we all helped each other if one person was staying late we all stayed late there was one time he was like where are you going at 5 30. Victoria's still
    testing go test with her yeah there was never a time where he ever let us off on not being a team player and that was the biggest thing he probably ever taught me was get get down there with your team if you don't know it learn it if all you can do is sit there sit next to them and rub their back and give them a donut like do that um supporting your team never saying it's not my job never saying you can't do it and gaining as many skills in your tool belt as you can and talking testing I'm talking I learned HTML testing I
    learned how to create automated QA tests back-end databases he contracted me out to the test for a client I had never tested in the day in my life and he goes you better learn so you know he threw us to the fire and it was either burn or rise up and that's the biggest thing he taught all of us wow so two years in college you do all these kind of you know techy things a little facilitation testing learning uh how to work with Team um so you you probably got some experience as a scrum Master let's hear
    about like how do you use all of this and let it landed your another scrum Master like what um what was that process like after you graduated so it's very very very important to know that whenever you're becoming a scrum Master especially if you do not come from a technical field you cannot lead what you do not understand that's the biggest thing um so in my years of uh of being an apprentice as a scrum Master that's what my boss taught me you need to understand what they're doing you need to
    understand what they're building otherwise you will not have respect in this field so that is really what I took in learning to test to QA to build code to understand databases to understand git lab I am I knew if I was going to lead a team of senior Engineers men yeah very much 15 years of working experience more than I I better come and I better know my stuff and I better be good and I can't yeah one mistake in this field you're written off um and so I really took that very seriously I made sure that I I had my
    stuff together um when I was in a meeting I was well prepared I knew what I was going to say I never I never winged it I was always very very prepared because I knew that the odds were stuck against me and you know there were other scrum Masters waiting to take my place um and so that was a huge thing that I took in just knowing that the odds were stuck against me um I knew I was the only female on a team of three other scrum Master men I was you know in I was many times the only female in a call of all men talking
    talking different scrum things of people leading database teams all these other things I knew I didn't know so I knew that I always had to show up and be confident and even if I did not know the answer to something I knew how to communicate back a firm answer of saying either I can look into that for you I can find that out I'll get that to you in five minutes like knowing how to you're never gonna know everything ever yeah I still don't know everything but having key knowledge of communicating
    effectively to be able to say let me get back to you on that um that is how you can survive in this field because like I said you're not gonna know everything but yeah you know I never said on a call and said I don't know never my boss would have killed me you know so I think those are some of the things that I picked up along the way of that really helped me to not fake it till I make it but you know I have confidence in myself I knew that I could even if I said yes I'll get that report to you I knew I can go find someone who
    could help me you know so those are some of the core things and then you know with my company we ended up uh selling the software company to our largest customer based out of Dallas a large healthcare provider and uh I then became a part of that team we went through interview process is and they hired us on to lead those games and so that's where I transitioned out from the startup to a large Enterprise level safe Agile environment nice yeah um just to summarize you kind of spoke a lot about you know what you did your
    mindset um I would love to have you summarize like soft skill wise right for people who are trying to transition like what are some soft skills uh and mindset people need to know if they want to compete and become a scrum master in an Enterprise team so in any really in any other team you need to be a really clear and concise communicator that is a skill um that can be learned um but you need to be able to get your point across you need to be able to you know command a room when you need to you're there to organize things yeah you
    will deal with difficult people you will deal with people saying no I'm not going to do that you need to then figure out how can I make them think it's their idea how can I make them think that this idea I have I know it's going to work how do I twist it to make them see the value in it yeah any new team I ever approach as a scrum master I approached it with teaching me your ways how are you guys working what's working for you guys what do you guys want how can I as a scrum Master make your life easier I'm
    here to make your life easier that was always how I approached these new teams in a sense of like building that trust with them where they think like oh I can go to Michaela for this or let me bounce that off in Michaela becoming that person that's a safe a safe place you know building those you know soft skills is everything we're building those connections with them where you spend the first five minutes talking about their life um you know you especially if you're going to work in a very technical field
    you'll find a lot of people who do not have soft skills that they will have wicked hard skills code like a beast but they may not know how to communicate you as a scrum Master needed to bring that into your team and so whether that is playing hangman for five minutes before you do your Sprint retrospective you know whether that's doing trivia whether that is taking everyone into a room and actually standing up and doing a standing up together standing up it's really trying to build that connection
    with your team sometimes it feels like it's pulling trying to find a new lot of haystack I'm telling you it can be difficult but I think those soft skills is everything between communicating building relationships and the most important building trust nice nice and let's go to the hard skill so I mean you kind of mentioned um some things about heart skills and Technical skill skills so one question that we're asked a lot is do you need to become a technical person in the beginning as a scrum master
    so with anything technical person there's a lot to unpack in that it's like what type of technical are you right so you know a product owner isn't all the time technical in the sense of their coding or building or sorting through databases or their testing most of them will be just technical minded in the sense of they can look at an application and they can understand the flow they can give work off to a development team and understand what they're building um you know a developer is technical in
    the sense if they are Hands-On keyboard building code um I certainly believe that the technical skills of scrum Master needs if you are looking to join a software team this is you know Square Master's work I work in a marketing team now my technical skills are very different but yeah for my technical team when I ran those teams I needed to understand um the technical skills will be very customized to really what your team is doing so you know if you guys are building an application to launch in a restaurant you got to understand what
    you're building you know are we technical aspects like every single scrub team is so different but I think the biggest thing to know is especially when you're approaching interviews what what type of you know what type of company are you applying to are you applying to a fintech are you applying to a um you know a scrum like a new development team are you are they building features like if you have to kind of understand like what that team is and then you can you know understand you need to understand kind of
    everyone's role in that scrum team which which is difficult but you know qa's test and build I understand their process of like building test plans regression testing releasing you know the other aspect is you know um monitoring releases I understand that process so it's like you as a scrum master your technical skills is to understand the process of what your team's doing I know I can't code but I know the process of delivering code you deliver the code you combine it to a Sandbox the other people merge their
    code it breaks each other it tests you know you give it to GitHub and you deploy it I understand that process and so it is understanding those technical skills that everyone else is doing um which can be difficult especially joining a new team but you know as a scrum Master if you're coming into this industry you need to understand who your partners are in this industry yeah so for for you so you you understand you understood you know some of the foundations of you know testing working with the dev team a little bit but still
    like when you're going in into like a large uh company right um You probably didn't understand a lot of things you just somehow convinced that yeah I can learn these things I have some of these base level Foundation um I'm curious like what kind of things did you do to learn and equip yourself on the the technical things or working with stakeholders what kind of things did you do in your first 90 day after you became a scrub master in in that safety that you're talking about um I set up a ton of one-on-ones yeah I
    would set up teams with people uh people who are new who knew what they were doing people who I wanted to mimic what they were doing either in the sense of building dashboards building reports building teams in jira how they reported out their team to Jared I would just book one-on-one calls like it was a full-time job because it was um I aligned myself with people who were smarter than I was who knew what they were doing and I saw a phone call and I said can you teach me can you teach me can you teach me can you teach me can
    you teach me that I I did that and I I still do that yeah being curious is huge and so that is really I I would say I would sit on the calls with a development team they would have their development morning daily check-ins Michaela was there every morning 8 A.M because I wanted to see what they were doing that's how I learned by inserting myself into everyone's business all right that's a wrap with this episode thank you for listening till the end we hope these podcasts are providing value on your agile Journey if you
